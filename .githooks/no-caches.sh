# A COMPILED CACHE IS NOT SOURCE, AND .gitignore DOES NOT SAY SO ABOUT A FILE ALREADY TRACKED.
#
# `__pycache__/` and `*.pyc` have been in .gitignore since this repository was made, and the site
# repository had three `build/__pycache__/*.pyc` tracked anyway: an ignore rule is consulted for an
# UNTRACKED path and says nothing about one git is already following. They were committed before
# the rule existed and `git add -A` kept them up to date for months. Nothing is tracked here today,
# which is exactly when a rule is worth writing down.
#
# SO THE RULE IS CHECKED RATHER THAN DECLARED. This asks the index, which is the only thing that
# settles whether a file is tracked, and it asks about the WHOLE index rather than about what is
# staged, so a file that slipped in earlier is caught by the next commit rather than by nobody.
#
#   .githooks/no-caches.sh          refuse a tracked cache anywhere in the tree
#   .githooks/no-caches.sh --list   name them and say nothing else
#
# BYPASSABLE WITH --no-verify, like every local hook, which is why the gate workflow runs it too.
