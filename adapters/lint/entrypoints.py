"""Every field carrying a name reaches a page only through the function that renders names.

WHY A RUNTIME CHECK IS NOT ENOUGH. `adapters/interface.py` loads kari/app.js and asks it what it
would show, which proves that what reaches the renderer comes out right. It cannot say anything
about a call site that never calls the renderer, and every leak this project has shipped was one of
those:

  the catalogue tab wrote `esc(w.t)` from index.json and 2,430 rows stayed Japanese in English mode
  while `workLabel` sat unused two lines away;

  `credit()` translated the role in the bracket and left the name beside it, so a reader met
  `[author]やまじえびね`;

  the 発売 tab labelled a volume row from the bibliographic record's title, which the name store is
  not keyed on, and eight works were English on three tabs and Japanese on the fourth;

  `publisherParts` returned a plain string that its callers escaped, so the mark saying a reading
  is unattested could not travel with the name and a second function had to be written to carry it.

None of those reaches a renderer, so no amount of running one finds them. They are all visible in
the source: a field is read, and what is done with the value is not a call to the function that
renders that kind of field.

WHAT IS ASSERTED. For every field `adapters/interface.py` rules as carrying a name, every read of
it in kari/app.js must be one of:

  inside the body of the function that renders it, which is where the read belongs;
  an argument to a call to that function, which is a caller handing the field over;
  an entry in `SAFE` below, which names the function, the field and what is done with the value,
  and carries a reason a person wrote.

Anything else is a finding. `SAFE` cannot be used to wave one through: an entry whose consumer is
`esc` or a template interpolation is refused when this module loads, because those are the two ways
a string becomes part of a page and they are the whole of what this exists to prevent.

WHY A TOKENISER AND NOT A REGULAR EXPRESSION. `esc(w.t)` is easy to find and `workLabel({ work:
w.t })` is not, because what matters is which call encloses the read and which function encloses
that. A comment mentioning `w.t`, a template holding `${...}` inside a string, and a regex literal
containing a slash all defeat a pattern. The tokeniser below is small, it is proved on the file it
reads by requiring that the tokens it emits concatenate back to the source byte for byte, and its
test reintroduces each of the four faults above and requires this to catch them.

WHAT THIS CANNOT SEE. Data that reaches no call site at all. A field the build writes and the
interface never reads is not a leak and is not found here; it is found by `interface.unruled`,
which reads the DATA and requires a ruling for every Japanese-bearing field, so a new field is a
decision somebody has to make rather than a silence. Between the two, a field can be neither
unruled nor wrongly rendered and still be wrong in its content, which is what a reader is for.

# ── 併記: a renderer that answers in one language has to be asked twice ────────────────────────
#
# WHAT WENT WRONG. `workLabel` and `authorLabel` each test `LANG === 'en'` and otherwise answer in
# Japanese, because 併記 is `bilingual()`'s job: it calls a renderer once per language with LANG
# forced and stacks the two lines. Asked directly with the toggle on 併記 they answer in Japanese
# and say nothing about it, so the work page heading, the 作品 rows, the 発売 rows and the works
# list on a credit or a publisher page all lost their English half. Every one of them looked right
# in ja and in en, which is why it survived a reader, a build and a green gate.
#
# The reads rule above cannot see this. Those call sites DO go through the renderer, which is the
# whole of what it asks.
#
# WHAT IS ASSERTED. Every call to one of `ONE_LANGUAGE` sits inside a call to `bilingual` or to
# `inLang`, or inside a callback handed to `bilingual` by name, or is named in `PASSES_ON` below.
#
# §14b, WHAT THIS CANNOT SEE. It reads call sites and not output, so a renderer added to app.js
# and left out of `ONE_LANGUAGE` is invisible to it. `creditText` and `personShown` compose names
# without going through the three below and are not covered today.
