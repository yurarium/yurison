"""entrypoints.py: proving a name cannot reach a page except through the function that renders it.

COVERS = ['adapters/lint/entrypoints.py']

WHAT THIS HAS TO PROVE. Not that the lint runs, but that it FAILS on each of the four escapes that
actually shipped, because a lint that passes on today's file has said nothing about tomorrow's.
Each probe below is one of them, written back into the real `kari/app.js` so the fault is in its own
setting rather than in a snippet built to be caught.

The tokeniser gets its own assertions first. Everything above it rests on the claim that a comment
mentioning `w.t`, a template holding a brace and a regular expression containing a slash are read as
what they are, and the first version of it emitted `&&` as two `&` tokens, which turned thirteen
conditions into thirteen renderings.
