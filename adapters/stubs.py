"""A pre-rendered entry page per work, for cold arrivals.

WHY THESE EXIST. INTERFACE-PLAN §5. The single page is kept, and moving between works inside it
costs no fetch because the whole corpus is already client-side. What a single page cannot do is
answer a link followed from outside: a fragment never reaches the server, and a citation that
resolves only when JavaScript runs is a weaker promise than a bibliographic database should make.

So each work gets a small file at `work/<id>/index.html` holding its facts as real HTML. Someone
following a citation sees the work immediately, with no JavaScript and no fetch. Where scripts do
run, the page hands over to the interface at that work, so a reader ends up in the same view a
click would have produced. The stub is hit once per visit at most and never during use.

The handover is a redirect and NOT the bundle. app.js renders into the interface's own markup,
which a stub does not carry, so loading it here left the script with nothing to do and the reader
on a dead page. That was the first version and the browser found it, not the tests.

INDEXING IS NOT THE REASON. The site carries `noindex,nofollow,noarchive,nosnippet` and that stands.
The reasons are that a citation should survive a reader without JavaScript, and that a stable
address is most of what makes a reference work citable.

STALE STUBS ARE THE FAILURE MODE. A pre-rendered page outlives the work it describes: プリンセ「ス」
left the corpus and returned on the same day. `written()` returns every path it produced so the
deploy can delete the rest, which is the inverse of the carry-over rule and the one thing this
generator must get right.
